# dot.zshrc

## zshrc_zi
This is what zshrc I'm using. The doc is easy to read.

## zshrc_zinit
This is my third plugin management software. It loads asynchronously, works very well, but has an extremely steep learning curve. Also, the author deleted the repository and discontinued it. Currently a community version is maintaining it (I don't use this version because the documentation is not beginner friendly).

## zshrc_antigen
My first config is zshrc_antigen. This plugin management was only used for a very short time, because it does not load asynchronously.

## zshrc_ohmyzsh
My first config is zshrc_ohmyzsh. As more and more plugins are used, loading oh my zsh becomes very slow every time a new terminal is opened.
